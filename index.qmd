Hello, I am Tyler Dickson. I am former Green Beret turned programmer who is passionate about software. Although my academic background includes a Financial Economics Degree from West Point Military Academy, over two years ago I discovered a love for programming. I have spent every waking moment pursuing knowledge in various coding languages to include Java, C, Javascript, and Python. I have been recently been accepted into Georgia Tech's Masters in Computer Science program and will attend in Spring 2024. 


Due to my close connection with the military, I have always had a desire to help those who serve. As a Green Beret, I have had the pleasure of serving as a commander in some of the most politically sensitive and complex areas of the world from the Middle East, to Eastern Europe. That's why I set out to develop an application that can act as a “one-stop-shop”, providing soldiers with access to useful files, a consolidated list of military websites, tools to build and manage shooting ranges, competitive workouts, and access to current events. Check out the [Github Repo here here](https://github.com/tcdickson/Green-Collectives.git). Or, if you prefer a high overview of the project, check out the [README File here](GreenCollectivesReadMe.md).


I have also created a web application that seeks to solve one of the biggest individual issues that individual soldiers encounter on a day to day basis. File sharing. Similar to the way Github has provided an outlet to share files amoungst the tech community, I seek to provide a platform where soldiers can upload and share helpful documents. The file sharing site is structured around an HTTP API gateway that send requests to a lambda function in AWS to generate pre signed urls, and making GET and PUT requests to an S3 Bucket. [Click here](https://greencollectives.com/) to see the site. 

Finally, a copy of my CV can be downloaded [here](Dickson_Resume.pdf).
