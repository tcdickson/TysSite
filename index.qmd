Hey there, I'm Tyler Dickson, a former Green Beret who found his way into the world of software development. While I initially pursued/obtained a degree in Financial Economics at West Point Military Academy, a few years ago, I stumbled upon my love for coding. These days, you'll often find me immersed in academic pursuits, as I recently kicked off a Master's Program in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. 

Because of my deep ties to the military, I've always had a strong desire to support fellow servicemen and women. During my time as a Green Beret, I had the privilege of assuming leadership roles in some of the world's most politically sensitive and complex regions, spanning from the Middle East to Eastern Europe. This is what drove me to create an all-in-one solution—an application designed to furnish soldiers with convenient access to essential files, a comprehensive directory of military websites, resources for constructing and overseeing shooting ranges, engaging workout routines, and real-time updates on current events. 

You can check out the application from the Snap store here:

If you prefer a high level overview of the project, check out the [README File](GreenCollectivesReadMe.md).


Another fun project I recently completed is the creation of a web application aimed at addressing a critical challenge faced by soldiers every day – the accessibility of essential files. Just as sites like Github have made it easy for tech folks to share files, I've built a collaborative file sharing platform where soldiers can upload and share helpful files. The site is structured around an HTTP API gateway that send requests to a node js lambda function in AWS to generate pre signed urls, and making GET and PUT requests to an S3 Bucket. [Click here](https://greencollectives.com/) to see the site.
