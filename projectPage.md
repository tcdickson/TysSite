## Propositional Logic / Logic Circuit Calculator:
A C++ program that takes a series of logical connectives as user input and displays a truth table as binary output.

Logical connectives are pivotal operators that amalgamate or modify logical statements to construct intricate propositions, enabling the articulation of relationships among these statements. These are indispensable in building logical expressions and in analytical reasoning. Truth tables are essential tools in visualizing and resolving logical dilemmas, engaging in Boolean algebra, assessing logical equivalence, and facilitating decision-making processes. Boolean operations underpin many everyday functionalities, including search engine queries. 

Users input a sequence of logical connectives, and the program renders these inputs either as truth tables or as logic circuit diagrams. A suite of algorithms will parse and iterate over characters, variables, and constants to produce the desired outputs.
