## Propositional Logic / Logic Circuit Calculator (in Progress):
Connectives are symbols or operators used to combine or manipulate logical propositions (statements) to form more complex statements. Connectives allow you to express relationships between propositions and are fundamental for constructing logical expressions and reasoning about them.

Truth tables play important roles in the visualization and problem solving of logical problems, boolean algebra, determining logical equivalence, and making decisions. Boolean math is the basis behind many activities we perform every day such as entering a sentence into a search engine. 

The user will input a sequence of logical connectives. The program will output the connective in the binary representation of a truth table or a logic circuit. Several algorithms communicating with various methods are implementd to parse and loop through char arrays, variables, and constants.
