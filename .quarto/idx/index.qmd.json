I am former Green Beret turned programmer who is passionate about all things software engineering. Although my academic background includes a Financial Economics Degree from West Point Military Academy, over two years ago I discovered a love for programming. I have spent every waking moment pursuing knowledge in various coding languages to include Java, C, Javascript, and Python. I have been recently been accepted into Georgia Tech's Masters in Computer Science program and will attend in Spring 2024. \n:::\n\nDue to my close connection with the military, I have always had a desire to help those who serve. As a Green Beret, I have had the pleasure of serving as a commander in some of the most politically sensitive and complex areas of the world from the Middle East, to Eastern Europe. One thing I know for certain, is that the miliary is missing the mark in providing soldiers with the technological they deserve. That's why I set out to develop an application that can provide an outlet for soldiers, families, and aspiring Special Operations soldiers. Although the project is not complete, you can see a [demo of this project here](https://youtu.be/yswU-CFTsh4?si=49Sop1xRnDuBgrEI).\n\n\nI have also created a site that seeks to solve one of the biggest individual issues that individual soldiers encounter on a day to day basis. File sharing. Similar to the way Github has provided an outlet to share files amoungst the tech community, I seek to provide a platform where soldiers can upload and share helpful documents. The file sharing site is structured around an HTTP API gateway that send requests to a lambda function in AWS to generate pre signed urls, and making GET and PUT requests to an S3 Bucket. [Click here](https://greencollectives.com/) to see the site. (The site is constantly undergoing maintenence - reach out if you're unable to access). \n\nFinally, a copy of my CV can be downloaded [here](Assets/Dickson_Resume.pdf). \n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n:::{#hero-heading}\n```{=html}\n\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline\", href=\"https://github.com/tcdickson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n    <i class=\"bi bi-github\" role='img' aria-label='Github'></i>\n</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline\", href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-dickson-7571247a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n    <i class=\"bi bi-linkedin\" role='img' aria-label='LinkedIn'></i>\n</a>\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline\", href=\"mailto:tylerdickson17@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n    <i class=\"ai bi-envelope\" role='img' aria-label='email'></i>\n    </a>\n\n</a>\n```\n\nHello, I am Tyler Dickson.
