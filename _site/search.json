    "text": "Hello, I am Tyler Dickson. I am former Green Beret turned programmer who is passionate about all things related to software engineering. Although my academic background includes a Financial Economics Degree from West Point Military Academy, over two years ago I discovered a love for programming. I have spent every waking moment pursuing knowledge in various coding languages to include Java, C, Javascript, and Python.\n\n\n\nDue to my close connection with the military, I have always had a desire to help those who serve. As a Green Beret, I have had the pleasure of serving as a commander in some of the most politically sensitive and complex areas of the world from the Middle East, to Eastern Europe. One thing I know for certain, is that the miliary is missing the mark in providing the troops with technological tools it provides. Thatâ€™s why I set out to develop an application that can provide an outlet for soldiers, families, and aspiring Special Operations soldiers. Although the project is not complete, you can see a demo of this project here.\nI have also created a site that seeks to solve one of the biggest individual issues that individual soldiers encounter on a day to day basis. File sharing. Similar to the way Github has provided an outlet to share files amoungst the tech community, I seek to provide a platform where soldiers can upload and share helpful documents. Click here to see the site.\nFinally, a copy of my CV can be downloaded here."
